    "Make a Restaurant class, attributes should be:\n",

    "-  The food type\n",
    "-  Opening hours\n",
    "-  The maximum seating capacity\n",
    "-  Phone number\n",
    "-  Rating (list of all the rating scores, default is an empty list)\n",
    "-  Comments (list of all the comments people gave to that restaurant, default is empty list)\n",
    "-  Number of customers that are currently eating there (start a 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2nd step\n",
    "\n",
    "Add two functions: `customers_in` and `customer_out`, they both should receives a number as argument, which is the number of customers entering/exiting the restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "-  The current customers number variable should be updated on each function\n",
    "-  If the restaurant can't fit all the customers that want to enter, just refuse them (maximum capacity is an attribute of the object)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3rd step\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an `add_review` function, it should receives a comment and a rating score (from 0 to 5) as arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to:\n",
    "-  Verify that the rating score is really between 0 and 5\n",
    "-  Add the comment to the comments list, and the rating to the ratings list\n",
    "-  Bonus: You can add a `get_rate` function that print the mean rating of the restaurant (reminder: mean is sum/number_of_elements)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4th step ~\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `check_if_open` function, this function shouldn't receive anything as argument, it should only check if the hour is corresponding to opening hours.\n",

    "-  Fuel capacity\n",
    "-  Current fuel quantity\n",

    "Add a function: `fill_plane`, it receives a number as argument, which is the quantity of fuel you filled inside, it returns the price that it cost.\n",

    "Create another class: `Passenger`, it should have `name` and `weight` as attribute, name is the name of the passenger, weight is the weight of the passenger+his baggages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a `current_passengers` attribute to the `Plane` class, it should be a list that contains every passenger that is inside the plane.\n",

    "Add a `add_passenger` function, it should receive a `Passenger` object as element, and add it to the `current_passenger` list, passengers number should not exceed the max seating capacity.\n",

    "Bonus: `current_passengers` can be a dictionnary, associate every passenger to a place number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4th step ~\n",
    "\n",
    "Add two functions: `land` and `takeoff`, when the plane lands/takes off, it has one chance on three to crash (it's a really bad plane). This function should just print `\"The plane has landed\"` or `\"The plane took off\"`.\n",

    "-  name\n",
    "-  total money\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3:\n",

    "#### Step 4:\n",

    "1. Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.<br>\n",
    "2. Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every compound statement, including for, while, if, and def statements. <br>\n",
    "3. Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks. Make sure that all quotation marks are “straight quotes”, not “curly quotes”.<br>\n",
    "4. If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make sure you have terminated the string properly. An unterminated string may cause an invalid token error at the end of your program, or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not produce an error message at all!<br>\n",
    "5. An unclosed opening operator—(, {,or [— makes Python continue with the next line as part of the current statement. Generally,an error occurs almost immediately in the next line. <br>\n",
    "6. Check for the classic = instead of == inside a conditional.<br>\n",
    "7. Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it is supposed to. Python can handle space and tabs, but if you mix them it can cause problems. The best way to avoid this problem is to use a text editor that knows about Python and generates consistent indentation. <br>\n",
    "8. If you have non-ASCII characters in the code (including strings and comments), that might cause a problem, although Python 3 usually handles non-ASCII characters. Be careful if you paste in text from a web page or other source.\n",
